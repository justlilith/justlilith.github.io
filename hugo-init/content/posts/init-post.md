# Personal Site v2

The current site has a tumblr backend for content management and ease of publishing. However, it's time to move on: 
- I really want to try out Hugo 
- tumblr sites are much more heavy than I'd prefer 
- Pushing updates should be much easier on github pages than tumblr So, over time, this will slowly evolve into a replacement for https://justlilith.com

Sections:

- Blog
- - It's tempting to call it Blag, but it's just a blog for things that don't fit on Twitter.
- Lilith's Grimoire
- - This will hold blog posts that are development/CS-focused. Things I wish I would've known.
- Portfolio
- - Different projects I've worked on that I can talk about publicly.

Notes:
- I've never used Hugo, but I love Go, so this should be interesting :)
- I'm not sure what'll come up, but I'll be sure to tweet about it! Follow @imjustlilith for updates~
